# Data-Handling-and-Views

After going into the project directory, first cd into the backend
`cd backnd`,
and start by
`npm start` .
Next cd into parent directory and then frontend
`cd ../frontend` ,
and start that using
`npm start` again.

You will be asked if you want to start frontend on port 3001, since backend will run automatically on port 3000, say yes and the React app will start on your browser
